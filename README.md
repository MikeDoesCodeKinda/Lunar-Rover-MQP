This code was created by WPI's Lunar Rover MQP team. Much of this code has multiple versions and will be updated if new versions become available.

Many of these files are reliant on other functions or specific settings. The matlab files specifically may rely on external add-ons that are not included in every license.
The python code is mostly basic functions, but does use separate Adafruit packages that are available, specifically Adafruit Blinka.
